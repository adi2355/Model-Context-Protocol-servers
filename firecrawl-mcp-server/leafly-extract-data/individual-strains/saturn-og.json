  "description": "Saturn OG is a hybrid cannabis strain derived from classic, undisclosed OG Kush genetics and bred by Maven Genetics. It has the textbook OG looks, with dense, forest-green buds, thick russet pistils, and milky trichomes, and boasts an intense amount of THC, over 30%. It emits a pungent aroma of pine, lemon, pepper, and diesel. Expect a celestial, uplifting head high and soothing body tingles. For medical marijuana patients, Saturn OG can help mitigate symptoms of pain, muscle spasms, and insomnia. The dominant terpene is myrcene.",
