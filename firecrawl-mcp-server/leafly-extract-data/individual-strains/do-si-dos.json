  "description": "Dosidos, also known as \"Dosi Doe,\" \"Do-Si-Dos,\" and \"Dosi\" is an indica-dominant hybrid marijuana strain with qualities similar to its parent, a GSC-phenotype. With glittering trichomes, bright pistils, and lime green and lavender leaves, Dosidos weed is a feast for the eyes. Its aroma is pungent, sweet, and earthy with slight floral funkiness. These classic OG aromas blend nicely with medical-grade body effects that lean toward the sedative side with the addition of Face Off OG genetics. Those who smoke Dosi can enjoy a stoney, in-your-face buzz off the start that melts down over the body, petrifying the consumer with relaxation that emanates outward. The dominant terpene in Dosidos is limonene.",
