  "description": "J1, also known as \"Jack One,\" \"Jack 1,\" and \"J-1,\" is a high-end hybrid marijuana strain that is gaining widespread popularity. J1 is a cross between two famous sativas, Skunk #1 and Jack Herer, and is best known for its strong, uplifting, clear-headed buzz that allows for extra mobility. The flowers are emerald green and frosty with a sweet aroma resembling the unmistakable Jack Herer pungency. This strainâ€™s seemingly only flaw is the top-shelf price that tends to come with its exceptional quality.",
