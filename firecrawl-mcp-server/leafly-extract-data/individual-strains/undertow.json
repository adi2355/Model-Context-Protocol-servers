  "description": "Undertow is an indica-dominant hybrid cannabis strain made from a genetic cross between Gushers x Wet Betty, bred by Colors by Cultivar for a collaboration with Cookies. Undertow has pale green buds with purple accents and thick trichome frost, which emit a palate of fruit, gas, earth, and pine. Itâ€™s a sleepy strain ideal for nighttime or chill daytime romps, and helps patients with pain.",
