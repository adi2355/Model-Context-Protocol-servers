  "description": "Tangie Dream is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain that reeks of orange peel and rock candy. The strainâ€™s overall sweetness permeates the flavor, leaving consumers with a subtle tartness on the exhale. Enjoy Tangie Dream throughout the day to elevate mood and stimulate the imagination. This strain can be motivating in smaller doses, but it has a tendency to insulate the consumer in an whimsical euphoria with continuous use.",
