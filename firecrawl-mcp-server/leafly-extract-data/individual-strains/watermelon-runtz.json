  "description": "Watermelon Runtz is an indica-dominant hybrid weed strain made by crossing Watermelon Zkittlez with Runtz. Itâ€™s got bold purple buds and a nose to match. The effects of this strain are believed to be intensely euphoric, a little sleepy, and tingly. The dominant terpenes in this strain are caryophyllene, limonene, and humulene, which form a gassy, fruit salad nose with watermelon notes, and a sharp, earthy aftertaste. Medical marijuana patients say they often buy this strain during episodes of pain, nausea, and arthritis. The original breeder of Watermelon Runtz is Silent Seeds.",
