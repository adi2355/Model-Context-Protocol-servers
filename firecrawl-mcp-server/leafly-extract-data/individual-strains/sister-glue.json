  "description": "Sister Glue (GG1) by GG Strains is the potent and flavorful sister strain to Original Glue (f.k.a. GG4), which took the fast lane to fame in recent years after snagging several Cannabis Cup awards. This indica-dominant phenotype has a more piney aroma than her sister, though they were bred from the same parent genetics. Patients typically look to Sister Glue (GG1)’s heavy-handed effects to treat pain and sleeplessness.",
