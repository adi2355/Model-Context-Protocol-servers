  "description": "Recon, also known as \"ReCon\" and \"Recon OG,\" is an indica marijuana strain. ReCon is a perfect blend of two parts LA Confidential and one part Cannadential. The Cannadential father was chosen for itâ€™s indica traits and at times, the ReCon seems stronger than even the LA Confidential. There is plenty of magic in this cross for sure!",
