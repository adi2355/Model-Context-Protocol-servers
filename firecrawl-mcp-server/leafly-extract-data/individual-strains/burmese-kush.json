  "description": "Bred by T.H. Seeds and including the California classic OG Kush, this plant will be dark green and have a piney aroma with a sweet aftertaste and tends to give consumers a calm, mellow outlook. The effects also tend to come on slowly but can be strong and long-lasting once they do.",
