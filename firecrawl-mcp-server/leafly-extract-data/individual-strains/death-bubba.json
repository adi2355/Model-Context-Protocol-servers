  "description": "Death Bubba, also known as \"D Bubba,\" is an indica marijuana strain bred by Matteo Suleyman of Sea to Sky Cannabis in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Made by crossing Death Star with Bubba Kush, Death Bubba is a pungent strain that reeks of grass and skunk. It has a sweet, earthy taste that's clean on the palate. Death Bubba weed's semi-sedating effects can be known to cause couchlock, so be sure to use this strain when you have nothing important to do. Medical marijuana patients choose Death Bubba to help unknot tension and relieve physical discomfort associated with chronic pain.",
