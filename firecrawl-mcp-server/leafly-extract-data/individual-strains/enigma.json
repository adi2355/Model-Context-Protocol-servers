  "description": "The indica-dominant Enigma strain is as mysterious as its name makes it sound; not much is known about its origins, but Enigma is a long-lasting euphoric strain with earthy and tangy flavors. The natural progression of its effects begins with carefree happiness and ends in a sleepy haze. Enigma is a great strain for patients experiencing appetite loss and/or cachexia.",
