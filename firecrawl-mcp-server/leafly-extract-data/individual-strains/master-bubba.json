  "description": "Master Bubba is the perfect strain for those looking for true indica effects. Bred from Master Kush and Bubba Kush, itâ€™s popular for the treatment of pain, stress and insomnia thanks to the strong body sedation it provides. Master Bubba plants flower at 8 to 9 weeks with smaller, dense buds that can have a fruity, musky aroma. Kush earthiness is the main note in its smooth flavor. This strain can be very potent, making it best in the evening or as a nightcap.",
