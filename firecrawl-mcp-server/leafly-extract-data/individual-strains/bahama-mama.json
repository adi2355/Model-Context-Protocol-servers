This strain produces a productive and quick-hitting high that will motivate you to get things done on your to-do list. Because of this, Bahama Mama is a great choice as an all-day strain or for your wake and bake session. This strain features a loud flavor profile that smells like a mix of passionfruit and bananas. The aroma is similar, with tropical undertones bursting through. Medical marijuana patients choose Bahama Mama to help relieve symptoms associated with fatigue and depression.",
