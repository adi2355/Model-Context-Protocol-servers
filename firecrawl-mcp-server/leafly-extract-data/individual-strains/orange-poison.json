  "description": "Bred by Franchise Genetics, Orange Poison is a cross between Orange Juice Bud and the famous Durban Poison. This sweet and tasty strain delivers a citrus aroma reminiscent of tangerines. Orange Poison may leave you feeling stimulated, yet with a softer rush for those who may get a little anxious from Durban Poison.",
