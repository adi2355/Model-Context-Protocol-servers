This flower will have a strong, sweet aroma that may also include sour citrus or pine. The buds can be colorful, with tints of blue and purple, and should have a coat of long orange hairs. In higher doses, the blissful relaxation this strain provides may lead to drowsiness and help you get to sleep.",
