  "description": "Green Poison is a dangerously flavorful indica cross bred by Sweet Seeds. It pulls you in with a fruity and floral aroma, then delivers a potent dose of euphoria and body-numbing relaxation. Donâ€™t be fooled by the lethal name: the only thing Green Poison kills is pain, insomnia, muscle spasms, and appetite loss. This is a vigorous, high-yielding plant with ample resin production, and its quick flowering phase helps protect against mold and fungi. Green Poison has won numerous cannabis cups across Spain and Latin America.",
