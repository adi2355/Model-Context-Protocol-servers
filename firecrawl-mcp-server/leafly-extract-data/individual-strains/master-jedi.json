  "description": "Master Jedi is an indica weed strain made from a genetic cross between Master Kush and Jedi Kush. This strain is a force to be reckoned with, as it delivers a powerful body high that can make you feel like you’re levitating. Master Jedi is 23% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for experienced cannabis consumers who are looking for a strong and long-lasting buzz. Leafly customers tell us Master Jedi effects include relaxed, happy, and hungry. Medical marijuana patients often choose Master Jedi when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, depression, and pain. Bred by unknown breeders, Master Jedi features flavors like pine, tea and pungent. The dominant terpene of this strain is myrcene, which is known for its sedative and anti-inflammatory properties. The average price of Master Jedi typically ranges from $10-$15 per gram. Master Jedi is a rare strain that is hard to find in most dispensaries, so you might need to use the force to locate it. It is best suited for nighttime use as it can cause couch-lock and sleepiness, or as Yoda would say, “Sleep you must”. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed Master Jedi, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review. May the force be with you.",
