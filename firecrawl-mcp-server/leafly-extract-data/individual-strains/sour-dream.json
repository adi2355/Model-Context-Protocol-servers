  "description": "Sour Dream, aka Big E, is the energetic daughter of a Blue Dream and Sour Diesel cross, bred by Conscious Cultivators to honor both the breeder's mother and brother with a hybrid of their favorite strains. Featuring a strong, sour, fuel-like aroma, this hybrid takes after its Diesel heritage. A sativa-dominant hybrid, Sour Dream is extremely uplifting and fun. Its euphoric effects make this a great social strain. Perfect for being out and about, Sour Dream will ease anxiety while giving you energy equivalent to a cup of coffee. It placed first in the outdoor flower category at Oregon's first Ganja Cup.",
