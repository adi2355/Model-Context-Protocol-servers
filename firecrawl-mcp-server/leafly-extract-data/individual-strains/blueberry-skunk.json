  "description": "Blueberry Skunk is an indica-dominant strain of Blueberry and Skunk #1. Skunk #1â€™s vigor, yield, and reliability are preserved, and Blueberry brings its heavy resin production and sweet berry flavors, which blend with an earthy, skunky musk. It produces fat, resin-crusted buds during flowering, and effects are led by a long-lasting euphoric buzz that generates giggles as well as the munchies.",
