  "description": "Prenup is a sativa-dominant hybrid marijuana strain made from a cross of Wedding Cake and Miracle Alien Cookies (MAC). This strain produces a happy, euphoric high that feels energizing in small doses. Prenup is ideal for any wake and bake session, but continued consumption may make your mind feel racy. This strain features a pine-forward flavor profile with sugary undertones. Medical marijuana patients choose Prenup to help relieve symptoms associated with fatigue and depression.",
