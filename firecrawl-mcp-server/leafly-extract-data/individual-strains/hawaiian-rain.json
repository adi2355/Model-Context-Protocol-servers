  "description": "Hawaiian Rain is a hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between London Pound Mints x Jealousy—it’s a proper family affair that brings out the best of the Cookies family of strains. Hawaiian Rain parts the proverbial clouds with a strong, tingling indica-backed euphoria. It has a unique palate that blends diesel cake terps with lavender and berry notes.",
