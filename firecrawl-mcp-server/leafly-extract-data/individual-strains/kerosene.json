  "description": "Kerosene is a potent sativa-dominant hybrid created by crossing Sour Diesel with The White. It holds onto the Sour Diesel smell while taking on the trichome production of The White, ultimately building a distinctive and memorable strain in both appearance and effect. Expect uplifting but powerful euphoria that pairs well with creative activities.",
