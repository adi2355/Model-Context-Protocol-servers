  "description": "Spirit of 76 is a hybrid bred by Kindman out of Denver, CO, who closely guard the genetic heritage of their proprietary strains. It is known for having hints of purple coloring and a fruity bouquet of flavors ranging from sweet notes of fruit punch to the piney musk associated with Kush strains. Spirit of 76â€™s earthy taste finishes with notes of grape and lavender flavors that usher in balanced effects, which are great for relaxing, calming anxieties, and stimulating the appetite.",
