  "description": "Runtz, also known as \"Runtz OG,\" is a rare type of hybrid marijuana strain. Runtz is made by Cookies Fam by crossing Zkittlez with Gelato and it is loved for its incredibly fruity flavor profile that smells just like a bag of the sugary candy we all know and love. Popularized by the Runtz crew helmed by Yung LB out of Long Beach, Runtz was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2020. Runtz is celebrated for its creamy smoke that is smooth and welcoming. This strain of weed produces euphoric highs and uplifting effects that are known to be long-lasting. Purple Caper Seeds released the same cross under the name Gelato Zkittlez. Runtz is known by many names the world over including Zwirlz in the Netherlands. At least 20 variations of Runtz exist with many more to come.",
