  "description": "Blue Diesel, also known as \"Blue City Diesel\" and \"New Blue Diesel,\" is a hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Blueberry and NYC Diesel. This strain produces a pleasant, moderate to long-lasting body buzz. Thanks to its Blueberry genetics, this flower emanates a light berry aroma that is smooth, expansive, and fast-acting. This strain is optimal for daytime and comes with little to no fatigue or increased appetite, making it a desirable option for medical marijuana patients. Originally produced by Breederâ€™s Choice, Blue Diesel may provide just the relaxation you need.",
