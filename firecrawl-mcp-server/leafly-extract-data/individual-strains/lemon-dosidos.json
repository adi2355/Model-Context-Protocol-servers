  "description": "Lemon Dosidos, also known as “Lemon Dosi” and “Lemon Do-Si-Dos,” is a sativa-dominant hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Lemon Tree with Do-Si-Dos. The effects of Lemon Dosidos are more energizing than calming. Consumers who have smoked this strain say it provides a creative high that leaves you feeling focused and euphoric at the same time. In large doses, Lemon Dosidos can be relaxing and may make you feel tired. The flavor of this strain is citrus forward, with notes of floral lemon. This strain works well as an early afternoon pick-me-up. Lemon Dosidos was originally bred by Elev8 Seeds.",
