  "description": "Jesus OG, also known as \"Jesus Christ OG,\" \"Jesus OG Kush,\" and \"Odysseus OG,\" is an indica marijuana strain bred by Subcool's The Dank as the not-so-immaculate conception of Hell's OG and Jack the Ripper (talk about an “unholy” parentage). Consumers enjoy the lemony kush aroma of this indica-dominant cross, along with heavy effects that relax the body while leaving the mind functional and clear.",
