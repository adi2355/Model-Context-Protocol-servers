  "description": "Sour Alien (also called Sour Alien OG) is an indica-dominant hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Alien Kush and Sour Diesel. Sour Alien has a strong aroma that smells like pine, apples and skunk with undertones of diesel. Smoking Sour Alien will give you a body buzz that is cerebral without locking you to the sofa. This strain is bred by Cali Connection.",
