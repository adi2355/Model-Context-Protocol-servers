  "description": "Trophy Wife is at least two different cannabis strains. The primary of the two is Surfr Seeds Trophy Wifeâ€”a cross of Triangle Mints x Triangle Mints F2. That makes for an indica hybrid with minty, dank, menthol notes. For something totally different HGH Seeds has a \"Trophy Wife\" strain that crosses The Wife with Cherry Wine. This CBD-heavy strain flowers quickly in 8 weeks, producing a quality yield with resin-coated, lime-green buds. This strain has a flavor profile with notes of cheese and skunk and undertones of cherry."
