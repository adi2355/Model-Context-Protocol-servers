  "description": "Grimace is an indica-dominant weed strain bred by Portland, Oregon's Archive Seed Bank. This deep purple strain features the genetics of two stellar strains: Purple Urkle and Face Off OG bx1. Archive notes that, in addition to oozing delicious grape notes, the Face Off adds a little twist of lime-y funk to the mix. Contrary to what its name may suggest, Grimace's indica genetics make it a great choice for any consumer seeking sedative, mellow effects from their cannabis.",
