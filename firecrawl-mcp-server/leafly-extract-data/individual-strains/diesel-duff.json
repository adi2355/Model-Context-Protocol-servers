  "description": "Diesel Duff is a happy, mellow strain that may just have your thoughts spinning off into new tangents. This strain’s effects tend to be more sativa in nature, taking after its Sour Diesel genetics. It’s a great choice for taming the mind during daytime and getting things done as long as your pursuits are not too labor-intensive.",
