  "description": "The genetics all-stars at Archive Seed Bank have hit jackpot with this stellar strain. A cross of a Gorilla Glue #4 mother and a MoonBow #75 father, Petro Chem brings out the pungent funk of the Glue alongside the tropical and herbal Kush influences of MoonBow. Despite what its name may suggest, this strain is this a mouthwatering treat. Its flowers produce resinous lime green nugs drenched in trichomes, while the high is potent and hits just like its mother.",
