  "description": "Platinum Garlic Cookies is a hybrid marijuana strain - a cross of the unique Garlic Cookies (aka GMO Cookies) and Platinum GSC. The result is a very dense, colorful flower with gassy, sweet garlic notes all the way through. We’re still learning about the effects of Platinum Garlic Cookies, so if you’ve smoked this strain before, tell us about it by leaving a review.",
