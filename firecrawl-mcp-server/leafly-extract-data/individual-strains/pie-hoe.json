  "description": "Coming from Cannarado, Pie Hoe crosses Grape Pie and Tahoe OG. Pie Hoe is 50% sativa and 50% indica. Pie Hoe was developed in Colorado and then sent to the Jungle Boyz in L.A., who selected the best pheno to give it traction to become a new favorite. An incredibly dank OG with a bit of grape flavor, Pie Hoe is a gassy, fruity, and pungent strain that will make your mouth water. Its high is not for the faint of heart, as it will swallow you up into a state of bliss for hours before slowly fading away.",
