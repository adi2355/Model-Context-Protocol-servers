  "description": "Lemon Jeffery by Irie Genetics was created when Rasta Jeff blended Golden Goat with Lemon Skunk. Rasta Jeff bred these strains together to improve Lemon Skunk’s lanky structure while preserving the strain’s distinct lemon candy flavor. Lemon Jeffery can reach into the mid-20% THC range, and can produce a heavy yield if given the space to grow. This strain has an approximate flowering time of 70 days.",
