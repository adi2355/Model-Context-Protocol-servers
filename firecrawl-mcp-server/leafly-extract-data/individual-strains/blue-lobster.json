  "description": "We know Maine does lobster like no other, but their cannabis reputation is poised to eclipse it. Maine Trees’ Blue Lobster, a Compound Genetics cross of Apples and Bananas x Eye Candy, took three awards at the East Coast 2023 Zalympix: Gassiest, Best Terps, and runner-up for Best Overall. We see why—Blue Lobster is flush with blueberry candy terps layered with grape that bloom from deep green buds tinged with a dark periwinkle beneath clawfuls of frost. As the breeders state, she’s “in a league all her own.”",
