  "description": "Alien OG, also known as \"Alien OG Kush,\" is a hybrid cross of Tahoe OG and Alien Kush. First available as a clone in Californiaâ€™s Bay Area and now in seed form from Cali Connection, Alien OG has the typical lemon and pine OG smell and flavor, and its intense high combines heavy body effects and a psychedelic cerebral buzz. Beginners and novices, be sure to take it slow with this heavy-hitter.",
