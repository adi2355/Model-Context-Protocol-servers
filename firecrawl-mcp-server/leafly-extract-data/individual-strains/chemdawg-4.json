  "description": "Chemdawg #4, officially known as \"Chemdog 4,\" but also \"Chemdog #4,\" and \"Chem 4\" is a hybrid marijuana strain. Part of the prominent line of Chemdog strains, Chemdawg #4 is known to deliver a balance of cerebral invigoration alongside relaxed full-body effects. Its smell has been likened to citrus or even Pine-Sol, with a lemon flavor. With light-green buds, Chemdawg #4 grows to be a fairly tall plant, reaching up to 7 feet outdoors and 4-5 feet indoors, and its flowering time is 9-10 weeks. It often appears to have a large amount of crystals, with orange hairs growing from the buds.",
