  "description": "Blue Gelato, also known as \"Blue Gelato #41,\" is a deliciously sweet hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing DJ Shortâ€™s old school Blueberry with GSC and Sherbert. With so many delicious strains at play, Blue Gelato puts out a smooth earthy, citrus, and fruity terpene profile that tastes as good as it smells. As for the high, you can expect to feel lofty and free in a state of euphoric bliss. Blue Gelato was originally bred by Barnys Farm.",
