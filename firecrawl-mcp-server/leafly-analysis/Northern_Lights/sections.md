## Description

I am a 60 year old male who has had two back surgeries and have a myopathy called Pompe disease. I am about at the end of my time here on earth as this disease progresses and the best medicine I have found to relieve the pain has come from this plant. I was on the "normal" protocol of opiates from my doctor for years and then I tried this strain. Daily usage has allowed me to greatly reduce the dosage of the Morphine and Oxycodone with their awful side effects, and I live a much better life since using this strain.

I have 40+ years experience growing and using cannabis, a masters degree in agri/horticulture from MSU and will break each review down as follows from my own personal experience with seeds or clones obtained directly from the original breeders. There are many breeders selling this version of this awesome creation and although they have their differences, they are all good in their own way and are very similar unlike a lot of other old time popular strains. I have personally grown seeds from Sensi Seeds, Nirvana, and one other breeder that I am unsure of because I bought them through one of the larger seed banks about 10 years ago. All of them were similar in every category so this review applies to at least the two names mentioned and from what I have seen from other seeds obtained from other breeders, they are mostly very similar as well. There is a reason this is on the list of top 25 strains of all time and I believe its because you basically can't go wrong with this strain as far as quality and consistency.
