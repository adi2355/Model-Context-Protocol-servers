## Description

Just tried this for the first time. It really does smell and taste sweet like berries. GDP struck me as a creeper strain. I didn't realize how high I was until I tried to actually do things. I totally lost track of my phone for about a half hour. This feels very sedative. It's a very heady high that to me almost feels like a sativa, but it is relaxing instead of energetic. This is definitely a evening and night strain. I feel very mentally relaxed. More than any other strain has made me feel. My head feels empty, but in a good way. Like my problems, anxieties, and negative thoughts are being blocked or taken out of my head. This is truly a strain to help you de-stress and forget about a bad or stressful day. I have a feeling this will help me fall asleep quite easy. This strain is great for what I wanted it for. I like this strain. I rate it a 4.5.

GDP! This is by far one of my favorite stains. There is something special about purple buds. I love the physical high of this strain, it's so heavy and relieving. After smoking it, you just sit back and think, "WOW" I am HIGH!
