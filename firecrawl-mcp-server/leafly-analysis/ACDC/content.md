Happy

I was a stoner as a teen. Smoking from the time I woke up until the time I went to sleep. When I was 16 my whole family died and I took to weed as my safe haven. Until I developed severe dissociative-anxiety as well as a gnarly case of panic disorder. I stopped smoking because it made it worse- I remember the last time I smoked I took one hit and it triggered a panic attack and I spent the rest of the day thinking my leftover family would find me dead from a heart attack. I didn't die obviously, however I stopped smoking and years later now five years later at 22 I have used some CBD patches and some CBD oil and they have helped a lot- I decided I wanted to smoke again... I like smoking. I enjoy the puffs and the clouds and the social act considering I live in Denver, and always hate passing up a joint knowing how much I love it but can't have it. Gosh this is long okay to the review part, I did my research and looked at every strain, read every comment twice and then once more and decided I was going to try ACDC and Charlottes Web. I took one cautious puff at first and I kinda felt it. Throughout the day and now night I've been slowly smoking about two bowls and it's got a tiny kick because I have no tolerance however it's in my chest and I am calm and friendly and fun and I feel whole again. I didn't panic even when the mini head high kicked in and faed in less than a minute. My heart isn't racing and I feel no paranoia. No anxiety and I feel free and me. I would HIGHLY recommend for first timers who are scared or anyone with anxiety. Thanks to all who took the time to read my long story. Anyway- hope you like it!

Happy

Relaxed

Let me start by saying that I do not normally purchase CBD high strains. I've done 70 something reviews on high THC strains, but this will be my first ever high CBD strain review!

AC/DC is 100% awesome natural effective MEDICINE. I hurt my arm over a week ago, and the top of my forearm has been swollen and very sore. After that injury, I managed to injure the same arm even more. I believe I have tendinitis or something going on, and my wrist gets shooting pain from one side of my wrist/hand joint to the other. Very painful. The tendons that go through my wrist are swollen and creek when I move my hand up and down. Very painful as well.
I told all that to the lady at the Giving Tree Wellness Center and she recommended this strain despite me being so used to purchasing thc strains.

I'm so thankful I took her advice. Having smoked two good size bowls in a row ALL of the pain has eased up and the swelling has gone down. I can still feel the creeking kinda feeling in my tendons but the pain and soreness is all gone! I am absolutely sold on CBD for managing pain, muscle soreness, aches...

I am typing this out (though I probably shouldn't be) because I can actually move my hand and arm without it causing me pains.

AC/DC is such a wonderful strain, and I look forward to trying other CBD rich strains and products.

Euphoric

Relaxed

When the man at the cannabis store said there was a strain that would not get you high, I did not believe him. If there was anything in this life that I was certain of, it was that weed gets you high. Yet here we are 5 hits in and, although I feel different, I'm not very high. ACDC has a 1% THC 18% CBD profile, giving it one of the highest CBD/THC ratios known to man. Don't let its sativa dominance throw you off, this weed is for chilling. I feel a relaxed but elevated mood, reduced anxiety, and easily flowing thoughts. Things are funnier than they should be. I feel none of the 'psychoactive' effects such as altered thoughts or paranoia. This also means you lose some of the positive psychoactive effects, like tripping out to visuals/music. You'll feel happy, but not in a high way. You don't feel altered, you still feel like yourself. Think of it this way: its a subtle strain that you can smoke a lot of before feeling uncomfortably high.
