## Description

I was a stoner as a teen. Smoking from the time I woke up until the time I went to sleep. When I was 16 my whole family died and I took to weed as my safe haven. Until I developed severe dissociative-anxiety as well as a gnarly case of panic disorder. I stopped smoking because it made it worse- I remember the last time I smoked I took one hit and it triggered a panic attack and I spent the rest of the day thinking my leftover family would find me dead from a heart attack. I didn't die obviously, however I stopped smoking and years later now five years later at 22 I have used some CBD patches and some CBD oil and they have helped a lot- I decided I wanted to smoke again... I like smoking. I enjoy the puffs and the clouds and the social act considering I live in Denver, and always hate passing up a joint knowing how much I love it but can't have it. Gosh this is long okay to the review part, I did my research and looked at every strain, read every comment twice and then once more and decided I was going to try ACDC and Charlottes Web. I took one cautious puff at first and I kinda felt it. Throughout the day and now night I've been slowly smoking about two bowls and it's got a tiny kick because I have no tolerance however it's in my chest and I am calm and friendly and fun and I feel whole again. I didn't panic even when the mini head high kicked in and faed in less than a minute. My heart isn't racing and I feel no paranoia. No anxiety and I feel free and me. I would HIGHLY recommend for first timers who are scared or anyone with anxiety. Thanks to all who took the time to read my long story. Anyway- hope you like it!
