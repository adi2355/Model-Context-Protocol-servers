## Description

I’ll prob never leave another review because I’m worried about giving bad advice.
If your body’s chemistry is like mine, after $10k spent on soooo many varieties- found them. Panic was the main issue I NEEDED help with to even function! Og18 is best for me in the morning. Yes, morning. I realize this would create sleepiness for ‘normal’ people. I get kinda tired, but PANIC IS GONE! Faster than Xanax! And Runtz keeps me level all day. Runtz isn’t as good for STOPPING panic for me, but Runtz keeps my anxiety lower throughout day.

Hope I helped someone.
I doubt it because no one will read a review this long, lol.

I love this strain! Hubby too. I pack a bowl after sending our kids off to school then get busy on the house. Makes me feel uplifted, giddy and productive. I feel it more in the back of my head than the front which I like. It gives me a good buzz without affecting my thinking and function. Nice to smoke in the morning and evening but not too late or I can't sleep. Would definitely recommend.
