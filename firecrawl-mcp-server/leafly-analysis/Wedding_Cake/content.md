it's me and my husband's 13 year anniversary today and we wanted to get something to smoke together. this was a great choice on this special day. we smoked a gram joint while staring out at the waterfront watching boats and seagulls and jellyfish and other weird creatures that we're still not sure we really saw. I blanked out for about a minute contemplating whether that jellyfish was really an octopus. because that'd be cool. so yeah. recommend. now we're eating tacos.

I took 3 large bong hits about 20 minutes ago....

A+++!!

It's been a very long time since I've been this high (with a dash of stoned) and it's a fantastic high!

I picked this up today while I was looking for a new sativa to try. During the day I like to smoke something that will both keep me alert and mentally clear. So far, now 40 min after bong hits (and this is all I've written), and I'm definitely alert and thoroughly enjoying the hell out of the strain.

I wouldn't smoke it during the day though, not because it makes me tired (I'm completely wired from it) but because my brain simply doesn't function well enough to work (or do much of anything for that matter).

I'd recommend starting with 1 or 2 bong hits first and give it about 15 minutes. This is definitely a "creeper" high so be careful.

Super fun high balanced with just the right amount of stoned!! I can't say enough about this pot. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be super stoned but not too tired. I'm really glad I bought it. It may be my new all time favorite weed.

Enjoy!

Euphoric

Happy

Hungry

Relaxed

As implied on my name I love this shit. Smoking this shit through a pipe will hurt but it leaves that sweet taste in your throat for at least two days. While in this strain I experienced mass relaxation and even to a point where my friend just passed the fuck out. Listening to music makes the experience ten times better as usual and god damn it gives me a sweet tooth. Have cherry pop tarts on deck for best food or watch The Eric Andre show or Reading Rainbow. I have no idea why but it’s fucking amazing.
