## Description

Okay so I just smoked a dime of this strain. I'm going to talk about it in categories so enjoy:

Look: It looks like a sour green with a side of some red hairs. 4/5
Smell: Almost a diesel type smell hence its name plus a little touch of pine, just a little bit. 4.5/5
Inhale: Smooth until it reaches your lungs. 3.5/5
Exhale: Smooth but I guess it depends on how long you keep it in. 4/5
Taste: Piney and delicious taste, you will never forget it. 4.8/5
Overall High: Strong head high and really relaxing control over the body. It's a creeper and sometimes a direct hit depending on how much you inhale and how long you keep it in. The comedown is just simply perfect, Actually a good sativa to sleep on. Keeps you focused, giggly, happy, energetic on small amounts and definitely RECOMMENDED. 5/5 Stay Smoking!

I've only smoked the flower version of sour diesel thus far and lately I've been smoking alot of wax, kief, and hash, so when I finally for the 1st time tried Sour Diesel (since I'm normally an indica or hybrid guy), it took me awhile to finally get a chance to try sour d and all I could find at the dispensaries at the time here in Sacramento was the flower/buds, so I bought an 8th the 1st time and I got home and immediately packed a bowl with it and holy shit I was surprised and in a good way. I wasn't expecting the effects to be very strong in flower form cuz I've been spoiling myself with wax all the time, but this sour diesel had me feeling just right. I suffer from bipolar disorder and my depression gets very bad, to the point where I literally will just lay in bed all day and just cry for no reason and I'll be that way for 7-10 days at a time and I will only leave my room to take a piss and occasionally eat since I don't eat very much when I'm depressed. But man I took only 4 strong hits of this strain and I was happy all of a sudden, I felt a really nice warm pressure in my head and it was relaxing mentally and somewhat physically even though it definitely gives you energy, so u really get the best of both worlds. Next thing I knew after I smoked my 1st bowl of this I was jumping in the shower, and going and getting a haircut, and just taking care of little things that I normally wouldn't be doing while crying my days away with my face buried in the pillow 24/7. I take meds everyday and I take them several times throughout the day and I've been taking them since I was 18 and I'm 30 now and so far I have yet to try 1 bipolar medication that works as good as Sour diesel!!!
