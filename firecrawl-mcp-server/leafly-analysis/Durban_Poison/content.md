Durban Poison is like the "espresso" of cannabis. The raciest sativa I know of, it's a stimulating and clearheaded high with no trace of numbing or "stoning." It wakes you up, cuts through the bleary fog and leaves you clearheaded and bright, gives you energy to go and seize the day. Gives tons of energy and also an intense emotional euphoria... where everything is vibrating and you can't take the smile off your face. Can cause anxiety and paranoia if you are upset, it doesn't make you numb. Recommended for mountain biking, jogging, driving, studying, reading, and partying / socializing with smart people. My sample had purple leaf overtones, a licorice / anise smell and taste. FIRE.

Love Durban Poison. Such a solid high. Again, it's a Sativa that won't give you the munchies or paranoia (two big priorities for me), but will make you creative, energetic and euphoric. Never had a problem with this strain. Wouldn't recommend this one for sleep. Tangie, Casey Jones, and Jamaican Dream and most Hawaiian strains overall make sleepy a few hours after smoking. Not Durban Poison.

Durban Poison - My go to for getting my figure back after holidays indulgence! Its tightly compacted buds give you more than your money's worth. the high is mellow but energized. Never agitated! ....and the fact that I can feel this way and not want every munchie in my mouth, is the best part! My idea of a good energizing daytime high is "Durban Poison " you keep your focus with some added creativity and before you know it time just flies away with extra productivity on your sleeve.
